1. Which of the following are use cases in which you should model your data for performance rather than simplicity?

Correct Options:

It is expected that the solution will be designed with only 10 shards.

Don't get caught by the part of the sentence mentioning "only 10 shards". 
Unless you shard for geographical reasons, it is likely that you use sharding for performance reasons.

The application is being developed by 100 engineers.

This is a substantial team, so it is likely that your project is not that simple.

Incorrect Option:

There is not an applicable design pattern to the solution.

In most systems, there is often a possibility to apply patterns. 
Whether to do it or not depends on the system in question. 
Not having the opportunity to apply any pattern probably means that the system is very simple.

2. relation
one-to-one 一夫一妻
one-to-many 一个妻子可以有两个孩子
many-to-many 你的两个朋友，也可以是他的两个朋朋友
one-to-zillion 表示对应的数量很大，比如1个中国-13亿人，一般可以用[min,likely/meddle,max],
它其实是one-to-many的特殊情况，由于数据量很大，不建议使用embeded内嵌的形式。

3. 一movie有多个actor,一个actor可能出演多部movie,典型的many-to-many，
下面说法正确的是？
Correct Options:

Embedding actors in movies creates duplication of actor information.
Every actor who stars in more than one movie has their information copied 
in each movie document they star in. 
The information stored in the document may be as little as the actor's name, 
however it is still duplication. 
Any duplicate information that changed would need to be updated in more than one location.

Embedding actors in movies still requires a separate collection to store all actors.
If no "source" collection for the actor is kept, 
there is a risk of losing the information about an actor if the only movie they star in gets deleted. 
Also, because we keep detailed information about the actor, 
it is likely that not all of it will be embedded in the movie documents, 
therefore we need a place to store this information.


Incorrect Option:

When using one collection for movies and one collection for actors, 
all movie documents must have an array of references to the actors in that movie, 
and all actor documents must have an array of references to the movies they appear in.

When using references to represent a many-to-many relationship, 
there is a need for an array of references in only one collection. 
It is possible to have arrays of references in both collections,
however, it is not necessary and creates unnecessary overhead.
没有必要在many-to-many的两个collection中，都搞个外键关联。

4. one-to-one

Embed the fields in the document.

Embed the fields as a sub-document in the document.

Link to a single document in another collection.

These three methods are the main ways to represent a one-to-one relationship using a document model.
